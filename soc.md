### **The Nature of Life is to Grow**


The idea that _“the nature of life is to grow”_ means that everything living is meant to keep developing and improving. Growth can happen in many ways — in our body, mind, knowledge, and spirit.

According to **Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, this idea is very important in his teachings. He believed that through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**, people can discover their inner strength and true potential. By practicing meditation, a person can experience deep rest and peace inside, which helps them grow naturally and live in harmony with their real self.

Growth can be seen everywhere in life:

1. **Biological Growth:** All living things grow and change — from small cells to big creatures.
    
2. **Emotional and Mental Growth:** People grow through learning, thinking, and facing life’s experiences. This helps them understand themselves better and become stronger emotionally.
    
3. **Intellectual Growth:** We grow by gaining knowledge and new skills through study and experience.
    
4. **Spiritual Growth:** Many religions and philosophies teach that we should try to understand our true self and the purpose of life.
    

In short, **growth is a natural part of life.** Everything living is meant to move forward, develop, and evolve. This shows that life is always changing and full of possibilities.

## 🌌 **Order is Present Everywhere**


Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Order is present everywhere”** is one of his key philosophical insights. It expresses his deep understanding of how the universe and human life are governed by natural laws — perfectly organized and harmonious at every level. Let’s understand it in simple terms:

---


### 1. **Meaning of “Order is Present Everywhere”**

Maharishi taught that **everything in creation functions according to a natural order**, an underlying intelligence that maintains balance and harmony in the universe.  
Even when things appear chaotic or random, there is still a deeper, invisible order guiding them.

Example:

- The planets move in precise orbits.
    
- Seasons change regularly.
    
- The human body maintains balance automatically (heartbeat, digestion, healing).
    

This shows that nature operates in a perfectly coordinated system — **nothing is truly disorderly at the fundamental level**.

---

### 🧠 2. **Order in Consciousness**

Maharishi said that **human consciousness** itself is structured in order.  
When our mind is calm and connected to the deeper level of awareness (through Transcendental Meditation), we can experience this **inner order** directly.

When the mind is restless or stressed, our perception becomes chaotic — but when we meditate and settle inward, we begin to **align our thinking and behavior with the universal order**.

---

### 🌿 3. **Order in Nature and Society**

According to Maharishi:

- Just as there is order in nature, there should be order in human life and society.
    
- When individuals live in tune with natural law, society becomes peaceful, progressive, and prosperous.
    

So, **personal coherence** leads to **collective order** — one peaceful mind contributes to world peace.

---

### ⚛️ 4. **Scientific Connection — The Unified Field**

Maharishi often related his teachings to modern physics.  
He said the **Unified Field** (the fundamental field of natural law described by quantum physics) is the ultimate source of order in the universe.  
All diversity — galaxies, atoms, life forms — emerges from this **one orderly field of intelligence**.

---

### 💫 5. **Practical Implication**

When we understand that order is everywhere:

- We stop fighting against nature.
    
- We act in harmony with the laws of life.
    
- We experience greater success, peace, and happiness.
    

By meditating and refining awareness, we **tune ourselves to the universal rhythm** that governs everything.

### **Life is Found in Layers**

**Session: 2025–26**

Maharishi said that **life exists in many layers — from the outer physical world to the deepest level of consciousness**.  
What we see, hear, and experience with our senses is just the **surface layer**.  
Beneath that surface, there are **deeper, more subtle levels** of mind, feeling, energy, and pure consciousness.

**Example:**  
Think of an **ocean** — on the surface, waves are rough and changing, but deep below, the water is calm and silent.  
Similarly, human life has surface activities (thoughts, emotions, actions) and deeper, silent levels of awareness.

According to **Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, life and consciousness are not just one single thing — they exist in **many layers**, like the layers of an onion or the depths of an ocean. Each layer takes us deeper into understanding ourselves and the world around us.

#### **1. Layers of Consciousness**

Maharishi said that our awareness has many levels:

- **Waking State:** When we are awake and doing our daily work.
    
- **Dreaming State:** When we dream — our mind creates its own world.
    
- **Deep Sleep State:** When we rest deeply and the mind is quiet.
    
- **Transcendental State:** This is the deepest and most peaceful layer, reached through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**. In this state, we experience pure consciousness — a silent, calm awareness beyond thoughts.
    

### 🧠 2. **Layers of Human Life**

Maharishi described life as having several interconnected layers:

1. **Physical Layer** – our body and actions.
    
2. **Mental Layer** – thoughts, feelings, and emotions.
    
3. **Intellectual Layer** – understanding, decision-making, knowledge.
    
4. **Ego/Individual Layer** – sense of “I,” individuality.
    
5. **Consciousness Layer** – the deepest, silent field of pure awareness (the source of all creativity and order).

#### **2. Layers of the Mind**

Our mind also works on different levels:

- **Surface Mind:** The top layer where we think, feel, and react.
    
- **Subconscious Mind:** A deeper layer that stores memories and past experiences.
    
- **Transcendental Mind:** The deepest layer — where pure consciousness lives. When we reach here, we find peace, clarity, and creativity.
    

#### **3. Layers of Growth and Experience**

Maharishi taught that personal growth also happens step by step:

- We start by learning from daily life.
    
- With meditation and self-reflection, we gain deeper understanding.
    
- Finally, we can reach higher states of awareness — full of peace, happiness, and wisdom.
    

#### **4. Layers in Education and Society**

He believed that even learning happens in layers:

- **Surface Learning:** Studying facts and subjects.
    
- **Holistic Learning:** Growing emotionally, mentally, and spiritually through meditation.
    
- **Social Growth:** Using higher understanding to make society peaceful and harmonious.
    

#### **5. Spiritual Layers**

Spiritually, life also has layers — the **physical and mental** parts we see, and the **spiritual essence** within us that connects us to the divine or the universal consciousness.

---

### **In Short:**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi taught that **life has many layers — physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.** By going deeper through **meditation and self-awareness**, we can reach the **purest layer of consciousness**, where we find **true peace, joy, and connection with the universe**.

### **Outer Depends on Inner**

Maharishi said that everything we experience in the **outer world** — success, happiness, peace, or conflict — is a **reflection of what is happening inside us**.  
If our mind is calm, clear, and positive, our outer life naturally becomes orderly and successful.  
But if our inner world is disturbed or stressed, our surroundings also feel chaotic or difficult.

**Example:**  
When you are happy inside, everything around you seems bright and pleasant.  
When you are upset, even small things feel irritating.  
👉 This shows that the _outer world depends on our inner condition._

#### **1. Inner State Affects Outer Life**

Our thoughts and emotions influence how we see and respond to the world.

- A **calm and peaceful mind** creates harmony in our surroundings.
    
- A **stressful or confused mind** makes life feel difficult and disordered.
    

#### **2. Role of Transcendental Meditation (TM)**

Maharishi taught that **Transcendental Meditation** helps us reach a quiet and peaceful state within.

- It **reduces stress** and helps the mind become clear and balanced.
    
- It **increases creativity and understanding**, allowing us to handle challenges better and make wiser choices in the outer world.
    

#### **3. Inner Growth Reflects Outside**

When a person grows inwardly — becoming more peaceful, confident, and aware — it naturally shows in their outer life.

- They experience more **success, happiness, and healthy relationships**.
    
- Their positive energy spreads to others, improving their environment.
    

#### **4. Impact on Society and the World**

Maharishi believed that if many people develop peace within, it creates a **collective positive effect** on society.

- A peaceful mind contributes to a **peaceful world**.
    
- His programs like the **Global Peace Project** aimed to increase collective harmony through meditation.
    

#### **5. In Education**

In **Maharishi’s Consciousness-Based Education**, students are taught that inner calmness helps in outer success.

- When students practice meditation, they become more focused, confident, and emotionally strong — leading to better learning and balanced growth.
    

---

### **In Short:**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi taught that **our outer world is a reflection of our inner world**. When we are peaceful and balanced inside, our actions, relationships, and surroundings also become peaceful and successful. By improving ourselves from within through **Transcendental Meditation**, we can create a happier, more harmonious life and world.

## **WATER THE ROOT TO ENJOY THE FRUIT*

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Water the root to enjoy the fruits”** beautifully explains how **true success and happiness in life come from nourishing the inner source of life — consciousness.**

Here’s the explanation in simple words 👇

---

### 🌱 1. **Meaning of the Principle**

Just like a tree grows healthy and gives fruits when its **root** is watered, human life flourishes when the **inner self (the root of life)** is nourished.  
If we only take care of the leaves and branches (outer aspects like money, status, or appearance) but ignore the root (inner being), the whole tree — and our life — becomes weak.

---

### 🌿 2. **Inner Root = Consciousness**

Maharishi taught that **consciousness** is the root of all our thoughts, actions, and experiences.  
When consciousness is strong, clear, and peaceful, everything in outer life — health, relationships, success — grows naturally and beautifully.

So, to enjoy the “fruits” of happiness and fulfillment, we must **nourish our consciousness through meditation and right living.**

---

### 💧 3. **How to “Water the Root”**

Maharishi said that the best way to water the root of life is through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**.  
Meditation connects us to the deepest level of awareness — the source of creativity, energy, and intelligence within.  
From this inner strength, outer success follows effortlessly.

---

### 🌸 4. **Practical Message**

- Don’t just chase external results — focus on inner growth.
    
- Take care of your mind and spirit, and everything else will flourish naturally.
    
- Inner peace leads to outer prosperity.
    

---

### 🕊️ **In Summary:**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Root**|Inner self or consciousness|
|**Water**|Meditation, knowledge, inner development|
|**Fruits**|Success, happiness, peace, and fulfillment|
|**Message**|Nourish your inner self to enjoy a better outer life|

## **REST AND ACTIVITY ARE THE STEPS OF PROGRESS**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Rest and activity are the steps of progress”** teaches that **real growth in life happens through a natural balance between rest and activity** — both are essential and complementary.

Here’s a clear and simple explanation 👇

---

### 🌿 1. **Meaning of the Principle**

Maharishi said that **life progresses through a rhythm — activity followed by rest, and rest followed by activity.**  
Just like day and night, work and sleep, or inhaling and exhaling — nature itself moves in this alternating pattern.  
This balance keeps energy, creativity, and health in harmony.

---

### ⚖️ 2. **Why Both Are Important**

- **Activity** uses our energy — it helps us achieve goals, learn, and grow.
    
- **Rest** restores our energy — it refreshes the mind and body, preparing us for better activity.
    

If we only act without rest, we become tired and unproductive.  
If we only rest without activity, we stop progressing.  
So, **progress requires both.**

---

### 🧘‍♂️ 3. **Deep Rest through Meditation**

Maharishi explained that the deepest form of rest is experienced during **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**.  
In meditation, the mind settles down to a silent, restful state — deeper than sleep — which recharges both body and mind.  
After this deep rest, our activity becomes more efficient, creative, and successful.

---

### 🌸 4. **Practical Example**

A student who studies (activity) and then relaxes or meditates (rest) learns faster and performs better.  
Similarly, a worker who takes proper rest can work with more focus and energy the next day.

---

### 🕊️ **In Summary:**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Core Idea**|Life progresses through the balance of rest and activity.|
|**Rest**|Restores energy and creativity.|
|**Activity**|Applies energy to achieve goals.|
|**Result**|Balanced progress, success, and happiness.|
|**Method**|Meditation provides the deepest rest for dynamic activity.|

## **ENJOYING GREATER EFFICIENCY AND ACCOMPLISHING MORE**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Enjoying greater efficiency and accomplishing more”** explains that when the mind is calm, clear, and connected to its inner source of energy, **we can achieve more with less effort** — working joyfully and effectively.

Here’s a simple explanation 👇

---

### 🌿 1. **Meaning of the Principle**

Maharishi said that real efficiency means **doing more in less time, with less stress, and with greater satisfaction.**  
This becomes possible when our **mind and body are in harmony** — when we act from a state of inner calm and clarity, rather than tension and hurry.

---

### 🧘‍♂️ 2. **Inner Calm Leads to Outer Efficiency**

When we are peaceful inside, our **thinking becomes sharper**, **decisions clearer**, and **actions smoother.**  
This inner balance allows us to accomplish more because our energy is not wasted in worry or confusion.

**Example:**  
After good rest or meditation, you can finish in one hour what might normally take three — because your mind is fresh and focused.

---

### ⚛️ 3. **Maharishi’s Teaching**

Through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**, one taps into the deepest level of rest and awareness.  
This removes stress and recharges the nervous system, making both **mind and body more efficient.**  
As a result, we **enjoy our work more** and **achieve better results** naturally.

---

### 🌸 4. **Practical Message**

- Don’t struggle through stress — act from inner calm.
    
- Balance activity with rest to work smarter, not harder.
    
- True success comes when **effort becomes joyful and effective.**
    

---

### 🕊️ **In Summary:**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Core Idea**|Efficiency comes from inner peace and clarity.|
|**Method**|Meditation removes stress and enhances focus.|
|**Result**|Achieve more in less time, with less effort.|
|**Message**|Work from calmness, not tension — that’s true accomplishment.|



---


## **EVERY ACTION HAS A REACTION**


Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Every action has a reaction”** expresses the natural law of cause and effect — that **whatever we do, think, or say produces a corresponding result.**

Here’s a clear and simple explanation 👇

---

### 🌿 1. **Meaning of the Principle**

Maharishi said that **life operates according to natural laws**, and one of the most important is that **every action creates a reaction.**  
This means that whatever energy or intention we put into the world — good or bad — eventually comes back to us in some form.

**Example:**  
If we act kindly, kindness returns to us.  
If we act with anger or harm, negative results come back.  
👉 This shows that we are responsible for our experiences.

---

### ⚛️ 2. **Scientific and Spiritual Basis**

This principle aligns with both **science and spirituality**:

- In physics: _For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction_ (Newton’s Third Law).
    
- In spiritual terms: This is similar to the **Law of Karma**, which means our actions determine our future experiences.
    

---

### 🧘‍♂️ 3. **Maharishi’s Teaching**

Maharishi explained that when we act in harmony with **Natural Law** — that is, when our actions come from peace, love, and awareness — the reactions we receive are positive and uplifting.  
But when we act in stress or ignorance, the reactions create obstacles and suffering.

Therefore, to enjoy good results, we must first **purify our thoughts and intentions**.

---

### 🌸 4. **Practical Message**

- Think and act positively — it always returns as happiness and success.
    
- Avoid negativity — it only brings problems.
    
- Meditation helps develop a calm, clear mind that naturally chooses right action.
    

---

### 🕊️ **In Summary:**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Core Idea**|Every action produces a corresponding reaction.|
|**Related Law**|Karma / Cause and Effect / Newton’s Third Law.|
|**Message**|Good actions bring good results; wrong actions bring suffering.|
|**Goal**|Live in harmony with natural law through awareness and right conduct.|

## **Principle: “Purification leads to progress**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi believed that when our **mind and body become pure**, our **growth and progress** (in life, health, and happiness) happen naturally.

Let’s break it down simply 👇

1. **Purification means:**  
    Removing stress, negative thoughts, anger, confusion, and tiredness from the mind and body.
    
2. **How purification happens:**  
    Through _meditation_, good _thoughts_, healthy _habits_, and living in harmony with _nature_.
    
3. **Why it leads to progress:**  
    When the mind is clean and peaceful — like clear water — we can see things better, make good decisions, learn faster, and feel happier.  
    So, purity of heart and mind opens the way for success and spiritual growth.
    

🧘‍♂️ **In short:**

> “When we remove stress and negativity from life, our inner potential shines — and that is real progress.”

Both are necessary for full growth of human intelligence.

---

### **1. Knowledge from Outside**

- When each element functions according to its nature, harmony emerges automatically.
    

---

### **1. Diversity in Nature and Life**

- Nature itself shows diversity: sun, rain, trees, animals, rivers, and seasons.
    
- Each element has its **unique role**, yet all work together in perfect harmony.

## **🎯 THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS**

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi taught that **when individual parts come together, the total effect is greater than the simple sum of the parts**.

- In life, nature, and society, **unity creates extra value** that no single part can achieve alone.

### **1. Example in Nature**

- A single tree branch cannot produce oxygen like a whole forest does.
    
- A single cell cannot sustain life alone; the body functions because **all cells work together**.
    
- Thus, **togetherness creates more power and effectiveness** than individual effort.

### **2. Example in Society**

- Individuals have abilities, but **cooperation creates progress beyond individual capability**.
    
- A team, community, or society achieves **greater results** than people working separately.
    

👉 **Logic:**  
Unity + collaboration > sum of isolated parts.

### **3. Role of Consciousness and Meditation**

- Meditation helps individuals **develop inner harmony**.
    
- When many individuals are harmonized in consciousness, the **collective intelligence and creativity multiply**.
    
- This principle is applied in **education, management, and societal development**.

### **4. Practical Importance**

- Encourages **teamwork and cooperation**.
    
- Promotes **social harmony and collective progress**.
    
- Helps in personal growth by connecting with **the larger purpose**.
