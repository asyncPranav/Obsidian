### **The Nature of Life is to Grow**


The idea that _“the nature of life is to grow”_ means that everything living is meant to keep developing and improving. Growth can happen in many ways — in our body, mind, knowledge, and spirit.

According to **Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, this idea is very important in his teachings. He believed that through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**, people can discover their inner strength and true potential. By practicing meditation, a person can experience deep rest and peace inside, which helps them grow naturally and live in harmony with their real self.

Growth can be seen everywhere in life:

1. **Biological Growth:** All living things grow and change — from small cells to big creatures.
    
2. **Emotional and Mental Growth:** People grow through learning, thinking, and facing life’s experiences. This helps them understand themselves better and become stronger emotionally.
    
3. **Intellectual Growth:** We grow by gaining knowledge and new skills through study and experience.
    
4. **Spiritual Growth:** Many religions and philosophies teach that we should try to understand our true self and the purpose of life.
    

In short, **growth is a natural part of life.** Everything living is meant to move forward, develop, and evolve. This shows that life is always changing and full of possibilities.

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s principle **“Order is present everywhere”** is one of his key philosophical insights. It expresses his deep understanding of how the universe and human life are governed by natural laws — perfectly organized and harmonious at every level. Let’s understand it in simple terms:

---


### 🌌 1. **Meaning of “Order is Present Everywhere”**

Maharishi taught that **everything in creation functions according to a natural order**, an underlying intelligence that maintains balance and harmony in the universe.  
Even when things appear chaotic or random, there is still a deeper, invisible order guiding them.

Example:

- The planets move in precise orbits.
    
- Seasons change regularly.
    
- The human body maintains balance automatically (heartbeat, digestion, healing).
    

This shows that nature operates in a perfectly coordinated system — **nothing is truly disorderly at the fundamental level**.

---

### 🧠 2. **Order in Consciousness**

Maharishi said that **human consciousness** itself is structured in order.  
When our mind is calm and connected to the deeper level of awareness (through Transcendental Meditation), we can experience this **inner order** directly.

When the mind is restless or stressed, our perception becomes chaotic — but when we meditate and settle inward, we begin to **align our thinking and behavior with the universal order**.

### 🌿 3. **Order in Nature and Society**

According to Maharishi:

- Just as there is order in nature, there should be order in human life and society.
    
- When individuals live in tune with natural law, society becomes peaceful, progressive, and prosperous.
    

So, **personal coherence** leads to **collective order** — one peaceful mind contributes to world peace.

### ⚛️ 4. **Scientific Connection — The Unified Field**

Maharishi often related his teachings to modern physics.  
He said the **Unified Field** (the fundamental field of natural law described by quantum physics) is the ultimate source of order in the universe.  
All diversity — galaxies, atoms, life forms — emerges from this **one orderly field of intelligence**.

---

### 💫 5. **Practical Implication**

When we understand that order is everywhere:

- We stop fighting against nature.
    
- We act in harmony with the laws of life.
    
- We experience greater success, peace, and happiness.
    

By meditating and refining awareness, we **tune ourselves to the universal rhythm** that governs everything.
