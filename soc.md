### **The Nature of Life is to Grow**


The idea that _“the nature of life is to grow”_ means that everything living is meant to keep developing and improving. Growth can happen in many ways — in our body, mind, knowledge, and spirit.

According to **Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, this idea is very important in his teachings. He believed that through **Transcendental Meditation (TM)**, people can discover their inner strength and true potential. By practicing meditation, a person can experience deep rest and peace inside, which helps them grow naturally and live in harmony with their real self.

Growth can be seen everywhere in life:

1. **Biological Growth:** All living things grow and change — from small cells to big creatures.
    
2. **Emotional and Mental Growth:** People grow through learning, thinking, and facing life’s experiences. This helps them understand themselves better and become stronger emotionally.
    
3. **Intellectual Growth:** We grow by gaining knowledge and new skills through study and experience.
    
4. **Spiritual Growth:** Many religions and philosophies teach that we should try to understand our true self and the purpose of life.
    

In short, **growth is a natural part of life.** Everything living is meant to move forward, develop, and evolve. This shows that life is always changing and full of possibilities.
