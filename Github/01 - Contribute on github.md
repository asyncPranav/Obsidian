# ðŸ”¹ 1. Fork the Repository

# ðŸ”¹ 2. Clone Your Fork Locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

# ðŸ”¹ 3. Add Original Repo as Remote

This is important to **keep your fork up-to-date** with the original project.

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/repo-name.git
```

Check remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

Output:

```sh
origin    https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/original-username/repo-name.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/original-username/repo-name.git (push)
```

# ðŸ”¹ 4. Create a New Branch

```sh
git checkout -b fix-bug-123
```

- Stage and commit changes with clear message:
    

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Fix bug in login flow"
```

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

# ðŸ”¹ 7. Push Your Branch to Your Fork

`git push origin fix-bug-123`

`git add . git commit -m "Address review comments" git push origin fix-bug-123`

- The PR updates automatically.
    

---

# ðŸ”¹ 10. After PR is Merged

`git checkout main git fetch upstream git merge upstream/main`
