## 🧱 Technologies Used

All possible in Vanilla JS +:

- HTML5, CSS3
    
- Web APIs (`localStorage`, `Speech`, `Drag & Drop`, `Clipboard`, `Crypto`)
    
- `Date`, `Intl`, `setTimeout`/`setInterval`
    
- Modular JS (`<script type="module">`)
    
- Optional: Use third-party libs _minimally_ like Chart.js or UUID generator
